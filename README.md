This is a website for blogs that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The name of a the website; "BlogBuster" is a play on words of the now defunct "Blockbuster" company that rented out movies. I thought the name I came up with sounded really cool and I am pleased with it. The website could benefit from the addition of some new functionalities in the future such as the option to upload new blogs and perhaps the functionality for local storage too. Also, I plan to make the social media icon links active to link to pages that are related to blogging. More to work on and add in the future.
